//! Consolidated tombstone tests.
//!
//! Tombstone tests assert that intentionally removed features, files,
//! and code patterns do not return. If a merge conflict resolution
//! re-introduces deleted content, the corresponding test fails.
//!
//! Standalone tombstones (file-existence, source-content) live here.
//! Topical tombstones that are integral to a test domain (e.g.
//! skill_contracts, structural) stay in their respective test files.
