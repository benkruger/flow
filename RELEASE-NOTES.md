# Release Notes

## v0.1.0 — Initial Release

The first public release of FLOW Process — an opinionated Ruby on Rails
development lifecycle plugin for Claude Code.

### What's Included

**8 Phase Skills**

Every feature follows the same phases in the same order:

1. `/flow:start` — Create worktree, upgrade gems, open PR, configure permissions
2. `/flow:research` — Explore codebase, ask clarifying questions, document findings
3. `/flow:design` — Propose 2-3 alternatives, get approval before any code
4. `/flow:plan` — Break design into ordered TDD tasks, section by section
5. `/flow:code` — TDD task by task, diff review, bin/ci gate before each commit
6. `/flow:review` — Design alignment, research risk coverage, Rails anti-pattern check
7. `/flow:reflect` — Extract learnings, update CLAUDE.md, note plugin gaps
8. `/flow:cleanup` — Remove worktree and delete state file

**4 Utility Skills**

Available at any point in the workflow:

- `/flow:commit` — Review diff, approve/deny, pull before push, commit
- `/flow:status` — Show current phase, PR link, timing, next step
- `/flow:resume` — Resume mid-session or rebuild from state on new session
- `/flow:note` — Capture corrections automatically when Claude is wrong

**Infrastructure**

- SessionStart hook — detects in-progress features, injects resume context
- Phase entry guards — prevents skipping phases
- Per-feature state files — `.claude/flow-states/<branch>.json`
- Git rebase denied in settings
- Documentation site (GitHub Pages with Jekyll)
