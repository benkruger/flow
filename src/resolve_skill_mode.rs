//! `bin/flow resolve-skill-mode` — the single tested source of truth
//! for resolving the autonomy mode of any FLOW skill.
//!
//! Every skill's `## Mode Resolution` section calls this subcommand as
//! the single place that reads `skills.<name>` from the state file.
//! Given `--skill` (one of [`ALLOWED_SKILLS`]) and an optional
//! `--branch` override, it reads the block-shape config object
//! (`{"commit": .., "continue": ..}`) the `.flow.json`-seeded state
//! file carries, normalizes each axis, clamps it to the
//! `{auto, manual}` set, and returns a deterministic
//! `{"status":"ok","commit":..,"continue":..}`.
//!
//! Only the block (object) shape is parsed. A bare-string
//! `skills.<name>` entry, a missing entry, or a wrong-type entry
//! resolves each axis to the per-skill default — `flow-learn` is
//! fully autonomous (`auto`/`auto`), every other skill is `manual`
//! on both axes, the conservative direction that asks the user
//! before proceeding. See [`default_mode`].
//!
//! Read-only: no `cwd_scope::enforce` call. Per
//! `.claude/rules/external-input-validation.md` and
//! `.claude/rules/branch-path-safety.md`, the `--branch` override is
//! untrusted shell input and routes through `FlowPaths::try_new` so a
//! slash-containing, empty, or traversal branch surfaces as a
//! structured error rather than a panic. Per
//! `.claude/rules/security-gates.md`, `--skill` and each resolved
//! axis value are normalized (NUL-stripped, trimmed, ASCII-lowercased
//! via `normalize_gate_input`) and checked against a positive
//! allowlist — `--skill` against [`ALLOWED_SKILLS`], each axis value
//! against `MODE_VALUES`.
//!
//! `run_impl` returns `Value` unconditionally — every failure mode is
//! a structured `{"status":"error",...}` payload or a fallback, so
//! there is no infrastructure-failure `Err` path and the paired
//! `run_impl_main` wraps as `(value, 0)` per the "Exit code
//! convention for business errors" in `.claude/rules/rust-patterns.md`.
//!
//! Tests live at `tests/resolve_skill_mode.rs`.
