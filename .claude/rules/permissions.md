# Permission Patterns

## Specificity Over Breadth

Use the narrowest pattern that serves the consumer. When the
consumer needs a known file extension, use that extension — never
replace it with a wildcard.

- `Read(//tmp/*.md)` — correct when the consumer reads markdown
- `Read(//tmp/*)` — too broad; covers every file type in `/tmp/`

Directory-level wildcards are acceptable only when every file in
the directory is a valid target. `Read(~/.claude/rules/*)` is fine
because all files in that directory are rules.

## Consumer Traceability

Every allow-list pattern must have a known consumer — a specific
skill, plugin, hook, or tool that needs the permission. If you
cannot name the consumer, do not add the pattern.

Before proposing a new pattern, answer: "Which skill or tool
invokes this command or reads this path?" If the answer is vague
("something might need it"), the pattern is speculative and should
not be added.

## Adding Patterns

When adding a new allow-list pattern, name the consumer in the
commit message or PR description so the audit trail is preserved.

Example commit message:

```text
Add Read(//tmp/*.diff) permission for code-review plugin
```

This makes the allow list auditable — any pattern can be traced
back to why it was added and what breaks if it is removed.

## Never Remove Without Explicit Ask

When editing `.claude/settings.json`, only add entries — never
remove existing permission entries unless the user explicitly asks.
An entry may serve purposes the current task does not know about.

When an entry needs to be repositioned, add first in the new
location, then remove the duplicate — and explain the two-step
approach before starting.

## Never Edit Permissions Mid-Flow

Never modify `.claude/settings.json` inside a worktree during an
active FLOW phase. Claude Code enforces permission changes
immediately — removing or narrowing a pattern breaks tools the
current task still needs, causing permission prompts or hook
blocks mid-session.

Permission lockdown changes belong in `src/prime_check.rs`
(UNIVERSAL_ALLOW, FLOW_DENY) for target projects. The FLOW repo's
own `.claude/settings.json` is updated on main after the PR merges,
or during the next `/flow:flow-prime` run.
